    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Spag Bol. Rich, thick, incredible flavour in the sauce even if you only have time for a quick 20 minute simmer. Though if you can slow cook for a couple of hours, it really takes it to another level!
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Celery</li>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Canned Tomato</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste</li>
        <li>Red Wine</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large heavy based pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onion, celery and carrots. Cook for 10 minutes until softened and sweet – they should not brown (if they do, turn heat down).</li>
        <li>Add beef, turn heat up and cook the beef, breaking it up as you go.</li>
        <li>Once the beef has all turned brown, add the remaining Ragu ingredients EXCEPT the sugar.</li>
        <li>Stir then adjust the heat so it is bubbling very gently. Place the lid on and cook for 1.5 – 2 hours, stirring every now and then, then remove the lid and simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>The ragu is ready when the meat is really tender and the sauce has thickened and is rich. Adjust salt and pepper to taste, and add sugar if required.</li>
    </ol>
